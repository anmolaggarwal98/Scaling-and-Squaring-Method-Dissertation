Dear Assessor,

This zipped folder contains the following:

- My dissertation named `1040706` which is on 'Approximating Exponential Functions by Composite Taylor Polynomial' and it is in a PDF format. This is possible that some of the images may not load if you run the pdf using `Adobe Acrobat`. I recommend using `Google chrome` to open this pdf or `PDF Converter Enterprise` which for me works perfectly.

- This zipped folder also contains all the images of the graphs I have generated in the folder named `plots`, so feel free to look at them.

- I have also attached the code to all my calculations/graphs in the dissertation which is in Python. It is also available on the link - https://anonymous.4open.science/r/b10787f0-dbfb-4a8d-91ba-d1a4c6675e8c/   . I have tried to comment the code well so it's understandable to the reader. Feel free to run the code on your editor and tweak the parameters to get a better feel of my analysis. 

I hope you enjoy reading it.

Kind Regards,
Candidate 1040706
